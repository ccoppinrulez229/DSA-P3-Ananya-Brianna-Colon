This program utilizes a movie csv dataset with two data structure algorithms, specifically a max heap and red black tree. 
HOW TO RUN PROGRAM:
  1. The main code is created in Python, so it must be ran on an IDE or terminal with Python installed.
  2. Ensure the movies_and_ratings.csv file is downloaded and in a directory that the code will be able to access. This is where all the movie data is stored and what the program will be accessing
  3. Open DSA-P3.py file in IDE or terminal
  4. Install the required libraries:
     - pandas
     - cinemagoerng (pip may need to be installed onto your system for this to work)
     - flask
     - flask-cors
  5. After all libraries are installed, run the program.
  6. Follow printed instructions.

HOW TO RUN THE WEBSITE:
1. Open dsap3.py and p3 frontent.html in Visual Studio Code.
   - The dsap3.py file is a copy of the file that Brianna and Colin wrote with the connection to the frontend.
   - Ananya copied this file into the same directory with all of the frontend files to easily navigate and combine files 
   
3. Run the Python file either in the terminal with the command python dsap3.py or by clicking the play button.
4. Go to the p3 frontent.html file and click "Open with Live Server."
5. A tab will automatically open in your default browser. There you can interact with the website.
